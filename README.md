# Overview

Assisting Dana with building a Dynamic Webpage by using Java Script, CSS and HTML.
Creating tables and using filters to break down our data. 



## Results

Users can read Dana's article regarding UFO sightings and use this webpage to search
for sightings throughout the world. Users will be able to view information on the date, city, state,
country, shape, duration and any comment attached.

Dana has provided us with documentation of these UFO Sightings. With the data provided we were able to
break it down and create different filters for users. 
These filters will be labeled as dates, cities, states, country and shapes.

We've also created a simple way for users to clear and refresh the webpage.
By clicking on *UFO Sightings* in the top left corner you can clear all filters and start over.

## Summary

The way this webpage is set up is all search information must be lowercase and spent correctly. We could, however, adjust the HTML to allow uppercase or 
misspelling of the cities. We could also create a way to make the shape filter easier by creating a drop down. Not everyone is familiar with the different shapes UFOs 
could be in and this would allow users the option to search by the different shapes.
